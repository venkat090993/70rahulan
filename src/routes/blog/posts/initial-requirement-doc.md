<h1 class="text-center">HOW TO WRITE AN INITIAL PRODUCT REQUIREMENT DOCS</h1>

<p class="text-xl text-gray-800 leading-loose pb-10">Last week, I had a client who wanted a web app. He sent me an elaborate documentation including what framework I should use, what name I should give it to the component names. I told him, I couldn’t get an overview about what the app does because it had too much information. Either it is nothing or too much.<p>

<p class="text-xl text-gray-800 leading-loose pb-10">I’ll give a simple format that works best for me as a developer or consultant to understand the product or the idea of someone.</p>

<p class="text-xl text-gray-800 leading-loose pb-10">As a consultant I have turned down many jobs because we won’t be able to do it as it wasn’t our expertise or refer them to SAAS products like shopify, zohoCRM, etc. I have also had clients who wanted mobile app or web app, to whom I have suggested to go for a different medium (web/mobile/plugin).</p>

<p class="text-xl text-gray-800 leading-loose pb-8">The objective of the first email or the first call of mine is always to understand the product in simple terms without getting bogged down by too much information, <br /><a>so I can:</a></p>

<p class="text-xl text-gray-900 leading-loose pb-5">1. Decide if we are the best fit for the client, if not suggest some other existing tool or someone else.</p>

<p class="text-xl text-gray-900 leading-loose pb-5">2. Suggest what best medium, approach to use based on the little experience I have.</p>

<p class="text-xl text-gray-800 leading-loose pb-10">What I don’t need: There would be plenty of feature requests like notifying user on something happening, search, filter, many different add-on features. Also there would be flow on onboarding a certain user. Too much details — no!</p>

<p class="text-xl text-gray-800 leading-loose pb-10">What I need: There will always be a core or main element like the sun in a solar system. Most of the actions would be around it. There can be typically one or two main elements, maximum of 3.</p>

<p class="text-2xl text-center text-gray-900 leading-loose pb-10">Here is a sample initial product requirement docs:</p>
